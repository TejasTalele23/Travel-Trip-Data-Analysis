🧭 Travel Trip Data Analysis

Overview:
This project explores real-world travel and ride-sharing data to uncover insights about user behavior, demand trends, and operational efficiency. Using Python and popular data analytics libraries, it performs data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and trend analysis to understand patterns in trip duration, distance, and fare.

Objectives:

Analyze relationships between trip duration, distance, and fare.

Identify peak travel hours, high-demand zones, and seasonal trends.

Visualize insights using bar charts, line graphs, and histograms.

Support data-driven decisions for transportation optimization.

Tech Stack:

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Key Features:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of trip datasets

🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing for accuracy

🕒 Time-based trend analysis (daily, weekly, monthly)

📍 Spatial pattern exploration of travel locations

📈 Visual representations for actionable insights

Results:

Identified Afternoon as the peak travel period.

Found that most trips are short-distance (1–2 miles).

Business rides dominate over personal ones, indicating professional usage trends.

Highlighted Friday as the busiest day for travel activity.

Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the power of data analytics in transportation, showing how raw trip data can be transformed into meaningful insights to optimize operations, improve resource allocation, and enhance user satisfaction.
